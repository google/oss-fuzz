# Integration rewards

We encourage you to apply for integration rewards (up to **$20,000**) once your project
is successfully integrated with OSS-Fuzz. Please see the details in our blog post
[here](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).

Rewards are based on the quality of integration with OSS-Fuzz, which is evaluated using
the following criteria:
* Upstream integration of the fuzz targets and build support.
* Performance of the fuzz targets and code coverage achieved with fuzzing.
* Regression testing in the upstream repository using fuzz targets and OSS-Fuzz corpora.
  Enabling [CIFuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/continuous-integration/)
  is the easiest way to address this.
* Discretion bonus to recognize outstanding work.

For each of the points above, the OSS-Fuzz rewards panel first sets up a cap of up to $5,000.
Then, the panel decides the actual reward amount (ranging from $0 up to the cap) for each
criteria, depending on how well the criteria is satisfied.

The highest cap values ($5,000) are awarded only to projects of a critical importance for the
global infrastructure and/or widely used products, devices, or services.

To submit your application for a reward, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5TlIXAiWRmbsHtPDR-8aDYKAZVgkJ5tcn6Dh-ym79r4iUxA/viewform) after reading the [blog post](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).
