## Bug Disclosure Guidelines

Following [Google's standard disclosure policy](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html),
OSS-Fuzz will adhere to following disclosure principles:

  - **Deadline**. After notifying project authors, we will open reported
    issues to the public in 90 days, or after the fix is released (whichever
    comes earlier).
  - **Weekends and holidays**. If a deadline is due to expire on a weekend,
    the deadline will be moved to the next normal work day.
  - **Grace period**. We have a 14-day grace period. If a 90-day deadline
    expires but the upstream engineers let us know before the deadline that a
    patch is scheduled for release on a specific day within 14 days following
    the deadline, the public disclosure will be delayed until the availability
    of the patch.
