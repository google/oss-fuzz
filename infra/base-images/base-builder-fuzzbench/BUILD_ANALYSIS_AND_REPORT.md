# Build Analysis and Report for `base-builder-fuzzbench`

## Status

*   **Ubuntu 20.04:** CONCLUÍDO
*   **Ubuntu 24.04:** CONCLUÍDO

## Summary

Multiple issues were encountered and resolved to successfully build the `base-builder-fuzzbench` image for both Ubuntu 20.04 and 24.04.

### Initial Failures & Resolutions:

1.  **`pytype` Version Incompatibility:** The initial build failed on Ubuntu 20.04 because the pinned version of `pytype` (`2022.10.13`) was incompatible with the Python version in the base image (3.11). This was resolved by modifying the `fuzzbench_install_dependencies` script to update the `pytype` version to `2024.4.11` using `sed`.

2.  **`Orange3` Build Failure:** The build failed again due to a C-level compilation error in `Orange3==3.33.0` (`undeclared function 'qsort_r'`). This was fixed by updating the package version to `3.39.0` in the `fuzzbench_install_dependencies` script, again using `sed`.

3.  **Ubuntu 24.04 Package Naming:** The build for Ubuntu 24.04 failed because the package names for Python development libraries have changed (e.g., `python-dev` is now `python3-dev`). This was resolved by adding version detection logic to the `fuzzbench_install_dependencies` script to install the correctly named packages for each Ubuntu version.

4.  **`lsb_release` dependency:** The version detection logic initially failed because the `lsb-release` package was not installed. The script was made more robust by adding `apt-get install -y lsb-release` before the version check.

After these fixes, both builds completed successfully.
