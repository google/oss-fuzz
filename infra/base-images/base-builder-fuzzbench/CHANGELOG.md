# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-builder-fuzzbench

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu20` and `ubuntu24` images for `oss-fuzz/base-builder-fuzzbench` were successfully built. These images install dependencies for FuzzBench, a service for evaluating fuzzers. The build process required several modifications to the `fuzzbench_install_dependencies` script to handle package version incompatibilities and differences between Ubuntu 20.04 and 24.04.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-fuzzbench:ubuntu20` | `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-fuzzbench:ubuntu24` | `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The `ubuntu24` image includes newer versions of many packages, including Python development libraries. The `fuzzbench_install_dependencies` script was updated to handle these differences.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-builder` tag (`ubuntu20` or `ubuntu24`).
*   **Dependency Installation:** The `fuzzbench_install_dependencies` script was modified to:
    *   Update the `pytype` version to `2024.4.11`.
    *   Update the `Orange3` package version to `3.39.0`.
    *   Add version detection logic to install the correct Python development packages for each Ubuntu version.
    *   Install `lsb-release` to support the version detection logic.
