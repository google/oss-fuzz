# Build Analysis and Report for `base-runner`

## Status

*   **Ubuntu 20.04:** CONCLUÍDO
*   **Ubuntu 24.04:** CONCLUÍDO

## Summary

The initial build for `base-runner` failed for Ubuntu 20.04 due to incorrect paths in `COPY` instructions within the Dockerfile. The paths were specified relative to the project root instead of the Docker build context.

This was resolved by editing both `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` and `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` to remove the `infra/base-images/base-runner/` prefix from all `COPY` commands, making the paths relative to the build context.

After this correction, both the Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 24.04 builds were executed and completed successfully.
