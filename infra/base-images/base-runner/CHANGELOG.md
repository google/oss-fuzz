# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-runner

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu20` and `ubuntu24` images for `oss-fuzz/base-runner` were successfully built. These images are used to run fuzzers and contain the necessary runtime dependencies. The initial build failed due to incorrect paths in the `COPY` instructions, which was resolved by making the paths relative to the build context.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-runner:ubuntu20` | `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-runner:ubuntu24` | `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The `ubuntu24` image includes newer versions of many packages, including Python, Java, and Node.js. The specific versions of other tools and libraries also differ due to the updated base image.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-image` tag (`ubuntu20` or `ubuntu24`).
*   **Dependency Installation:** The `install_deps.sh` script is used to install a base set of dependencies, which differ between the two versions.
*   **COPY Instructions:** The `COPY` instructions were corrected to use paths relative to the build context.
