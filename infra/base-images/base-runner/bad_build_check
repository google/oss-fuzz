# for memory poisoning.

# Usually, a non UBSan build (e.g. ASan) has 165 calls to UBSan runtime. The
# majority of targets built with UBSan have 200+ UBSan calls, but there are
# some very small targets that may have < 200 UBSan calls even in a UBSan build.

UBSAN_CALLS_THRESHOLD_FOR_UBSAN_BUILD=169

# It would be risky to use the threshold value close to 165 for non UBSan build,
# as UBSan runtime may change any time and thus we could have different number
# of calls to UBSan runtime even in ASan build. With that, we use the threshold
# value of 200 that would detect unnecessary UBSan instrumentation in the vast
# majority of targets, except of a handful very small ones, which would not be
# a big concern either way as the overhead for them would not be significant.
