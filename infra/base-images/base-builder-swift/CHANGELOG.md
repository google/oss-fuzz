# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-builder-swift

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu-20-04` and `ubuntu-24-04` images for `oss-fuzz/base-builder-swift` were successfully built. These images install Swift and related tools on top of the `base-builder` image. The build process for both versions is straightforward and relies on the `install_swift.sh` script, which is compatible with both base images.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-swift:ubuntu-20-04` | `ubuntu-20-04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-swift:ubuntu-24-04` | `ubuntu-24-04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

There are no significant package differences introduced in this build stage, as the dependencies are inherited from the `base-builder` image.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions are very similar and perform the following actions:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-builder` tag (`ubuntu-20-04` or `ubuntu-24-04`).
*   **Swift Installation:** The `install_swift.sh` script is used to download and install Swift.
