# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-runner-debug

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu-20-04` and `ubuntu-24-04` images for `oss-fuzz/base-runner-debug` were successfully built. These images are used for debugging fuzzers and contain tools like GDB and Valgrind. The Dockerfile structure was refactored to support multi-version builds by creating separate Dockerfiles for each Ubuntu version and updating the `FROM` instruction accordingly.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-runner-debug:ubuntu-20-04` | `ubuntu-20-04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-runner-debug:ubuntu-24-04` | `ubuntu-24-04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The `ubuntu-24-04` image includes newer versions of GDB, Valgrind, and other debugging tools.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-runner` tag (`ubuntu-20-04` or `ubuntu-24-04`).
*   **GDB Installation:** Both versions download and build GDB from source.
*   **Refactoring:** The original `Dockerfile` was split into `ubuntu-20-04.Dockerfile` and `ubuntu-24-04.Dockerfile` to support the multi-version build strategy.
