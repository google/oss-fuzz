# Build Analysis and Report for `base-runner-debug`

## Status

- **Ubuntu 20.04**: COMPLETED
- **Ubuntu 24.04**: COMPLETED

## Dependency Analysis

The `base-runner-debug` image directly depends on the `base-runner` image. The original `Dockerfile` did not specify a tag for the base image, which prevented building for specific Ubuntu versions.

## Action Plan

1.  **Create Specific Dockerfiles**: Generate `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` and `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` from the original `Dockerfile`, specifying the correct base image (`gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-runner:ubuntu_20_04` and `gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-runner:ubuntu_24_04`, respectively).
2.  **Handle Original Dockerfile**: The generic `Dockerfile` was kept to preserve the original content but was not used in the build process.
3.  **Build the Images**: Execute the build for each Ubuntu version.
4.  **Analyze Logs**: Check the build logs for errors.
5.  **Document Results**: Update this report with the findings.

## Build Logs

### Ubuntu 20.04

The build for the `base-runner-debug:ubuntu_20_04` image completed successfully. The main challenge was an initial failure due to the use of the `--pull` parameter, which was removed to allow the use of the local base image. The GDB download was time-consuming but did not present any errors.

### Ubuntu 24.04

The build for the `base-runner-debug:ubuntu_24_04` image also completed successfully, following a process similar to the 20.04 version.

## Conclusion

The builds for `base-runner-debug` on both Ubuntu versions were successful. The strategy of creating specific Dockerfiles for each version and removing the dependency on remote images with the `--pull` parameter proved effective. The image is ready to be used as a base for the next steps.
