# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-builder-go

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu20` and `ubuntu24` images for `oss-fuzz/base-builder-go` were successfully built. These images install the Go programming language and related fuzzing tools on top of the `base-builder` image. The build process for both versions is nearly identical, with the primary difference being the base image used.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-go:ubuntu20` | `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-go:ubuntu24` | `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

There are no significant package differences introduced in this build stage, as the dependencies are inherited from the `base-builder` image.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions are very similar and perform the following actions:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-builder` tag (`ubuntu20` or `ubuntu24`).
*   **Go Installation:** The `install_go.sh` script is used to download and install Go.
*   **Go Fuzzing Tools:** The Dockerfiles install several Go-based fuzzing tools, including `go114-fuzz-build` and `go-118-fuzz-build`.
