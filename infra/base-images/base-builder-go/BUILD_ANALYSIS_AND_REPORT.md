# Build Analysis and Report for `base-builder-go`

## Status

*   **Ubuntu 20.04:** CONCLUÍDO
*   **Ubuntu 24.04:** CONCLUÍDO

## Summary

Both Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 24.04 builds for `base-builder-go` completed successfully.

The build process for `base-builder:ubuntu_24_04` (a dependency) initially failed due to a linker error related to Position Independent Executable (PIE). This was resolved by modifying the `precompile_honggfuzz` script to include the `-no-pie` linker flag. After this correction, all dependent builds succeeded.
