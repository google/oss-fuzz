# Build Analysis and Report for `base-builder-python`

## Status

*   **Ubuntu 20.04:** CONCLUÍDO
*   **Ubuntu 24.04:** CONCLUÍDO

## Summary

The build process for `base-builder-python` required a refactoring of its Dockerfile structure. The original single `Dockerfile` was not compatible with the multi-version build strategy.

The following changes were made:
1.  The existing `Dockerfile` was renamed to `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile`.
2.  A new `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` was created.
3.  The `FROM` instruction in each file was updated to point to the correct version-specific `base-builder` image.

After this refactoring, both the Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 24.04 builds completed successfully.
