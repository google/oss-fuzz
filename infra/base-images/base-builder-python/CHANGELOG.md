# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-builder-python

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu20` and `ubuntu24` images for `oss-fuzz/base-builder-python` were successfully built. These images install Python-specific fuzzing tools, including Atheris and Coverage, on top of the `base-builder` image. The Dockerfile structure was refactored to support multi-version builds by creating separate Dockerfiles for each Ubuntu version and updating the `FROM` instruction accordingly.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-python:ubuntu20` | `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-python:ubuntu24` | `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The primary difference is the version of Python and its dependencies. Both versions install Atheris, PyInstaller, and other Python packages, but the underlying system libraries and Python version are different.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-builder` tag (`ubuntu20` or `ubuntu24`).
*   **Python Fuzzing Tools:** The `install_python.sh` script is used to install Atheris and other Python fuzzing tools.
*   **Refactoring:** The original `Dockerfile` was renamed to `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile`, and a new `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` was created to support the multi-version build strategy.
