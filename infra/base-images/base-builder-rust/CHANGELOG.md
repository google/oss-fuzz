The `ubuntu-24-04` image includes newer versions of the Rust toolchain and other related dependencies.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-builder` tag (`ubuntu-20-04` or `ubuntu-24-04`).
*   **Dependency Installation:** The `install_rust.sh` script is used to install the Rust toolchain, which may have version differences between the two Ubuntu versions.
