# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-clang

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu-20-04` and `ubuntu-24-04` images for `oss-fuzz/base-clang` were successfully built. Both images install Clang and its dependencies on top of the corresponding `base-image`. The build process for both versions is complex, involving the checkout and compilation of a specific LLVM revision. The primary differences between the two versions are the base image used and the script for checking out and building LLVM.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-clang:ubuntu-20-04` | `ubuntu-20-04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-clang:ubuntu-24-04` | `ubuntu-24-04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The package differences are numerous due to the different base Ubuntu versions. The `ubuntu-24-04` image uses newer versions of essential build tools and libraries, such as `g++`, `python3`, and `zlib1g-dev`.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-image` tag (`ubuntu-20-04` or `ubuntu-24-04`).
*   **LLVM Build Script:** The `ubuntu-24-04` Dockerfile uses a new script, `checkout_build_install_llvm_24.04.sh`, to handle the LLVM build process, while the `ubuntu-20-04` Dockerfile uses `checkout_build_install_llvm.sh`. This is necessary to accommodate changes in the build environment and dependencies between the two Ubuntu versions.
