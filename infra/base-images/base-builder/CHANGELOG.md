# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-builder

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu-20-04` and `ubuntu-24-04` images for `oss-fuzz/base-builder` were successfully built. These images contain the necessary tools and libraries for building fuzzers. The `ubuntu-24-04` build required a fix to the `ADD` instruction in the Dockerfile to correctly handle multiple files. Both versions install a variety of tools, including Python, Bazel, and various compilers.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder:ubuntu-20-04` | `ubuntu-20-04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder:ubuntu-24-04` | `ubuntu-24-04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The `ubuntu-24-04` image includes newer versions of many packages, including Python 3.11.13. The specific versions of other tools and libraries also differ due to the updated base image.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have several key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-clang` tag (`ubuntu-20-04` or `ubuntu-24-04`).
*   **Package Installation:** The `install_deps.sh` script is used to install a base set of dependencies, which differ between the two versions.
*   **Python Installation:** The `ubuntu-24-04` Dockerfile installs Python 3.11.13 from source, while the `ubuntu-20-04` version uses a different set of commands.
*   **ADD Instruction:** The `ADD` instruction in the `ubuntu-24-04` Dockerfile was corrected to use the proper syntax for adding multiple files.
