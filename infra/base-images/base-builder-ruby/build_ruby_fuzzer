# Unified Ruby fuzzer builder - handles both normal fuzzing and coverage modes.
#
# Usage: build_ruby_fuzzer <fuzzer_harness.rb> <output_dir> <project_name>
#
# This script automatically detects the SANITIZER environment variable and:
# - For coverage: Creates coverage-instrumented wrapper via ruzzy-build-coverage
# - For normal fuzzing: Creates standard fuzzer wrapper via ruzzy-build
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - Path to the Ruby fuzzer harness file (e.g., /src/harnesses/fuzz_parse.rb)
#   $2 - Output directory where the wrapper will be created (e.g., $OUT)
#   $3 - Project name for corpus directory creation (e.g., ox-ruby)
#

fuzz_target_path="$1"
out_dir="$2"
project_name="$3"
