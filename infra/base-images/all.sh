# A script to build base images locally.
#
# This script is a wrapper around `docker build` that dynamically fetches the
# official list of images from the Python source of truth, ensuring it never
# goes out of date.
#
# Usage:
#       # Build the 'latest' version of all images.
#       ./all.sh
#
#       # Build the 'ubuntu-24-04' version of all images.
#       ./all.sh ubuntu-24-04
