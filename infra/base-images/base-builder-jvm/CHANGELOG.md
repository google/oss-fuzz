# Docker Image Version Changelog: oss-fuzz/base-builder-jvm

## Analysis Summary

The `ubuntu20` and `ubuntu24` images for `oss-fuzz/base-builder-jvm` were successfully built. These images install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Jazzer fuzzer on top of the `base-builder` image. The `ubuntu24` build required fixing syntax errors in the Dockerfile, specifically missing line continuation characters (`\`). After these corrections, both builds completed successfully.

## Build Status

| Image Tag | Dockerfile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-jvm:ubuntu20` | `ubuntu_20_04.Dockerfile` | Success |
| `oss-fuzz/base-builder-jvm:ubuntu24` | `ubuntu_24_04.Dockerfile` | Success |

## Package Comparison

### Key Differences (Ubuntu 20.04 vs. Ubuntu 24.04)

The primary difference is the Java version installed. Both versions install OpenJDK 17 and 15. The underlying dependencies may differ due to the base image.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The Dockerfiles for both versions have the following key differences:

*   **Base Image:** The `FROM` instruction in each Dockerfile points to the corresponding `oss-fuzz/base-builder` tag (`ubuntu20` or `ubuntu24`).
*   **Java Installation:** The `install_java.sh` script is used to download and install OpenJDK 17 and 15.
*   **Jazzer Installation:** Both versions clone the Jazzer repository and build it using Bazel.
*   **Dockerfile Syntax:** The `ubuntu24` Dockerfile had syntax errors that were corrected.
