# Chronos: rebuilding OSS-Fuzz harnesses using cached builds

Chronos is a utility tooling to enable fast re-building of OSS-Fuzz projects
and analysis of projects' testing infrastructure. This is used by projects,
e.g. [OSS-Fuzz-gen](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-gen) to help speed up
valuation processes during fuzzing harness generation.

At the core, Chronos relies on caching containers after project build, in order
to enable fast rebuilding of a project following minor patches, and also enable
running of the tests in a given project. To support this, Chronos creates a snapshot
of a the docker container given project post build completion. This means that all `.o` files, generated
configuations etc. persist in the docker container. These artifacts are then
leverage for future "replay builds" where only a minor part of the project has changed,
e.g. due to some patching on the project. This patching could be e.g. minor adjustments
to the fuzzing harness source code e.g. by [oss-fuzz-gen](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-gen).

As such, at the core of Chronos are cached containers that are generated by taking a
snapshot of the container of a project post project build.

Chronos is focused on two features, rebuilding projects fast and running the
tests of a given project.


## Chronos features: fast rebuilding and running the tests of a project

### CLI interface for Chronos

The default route to validating Chronos is using the CLI available in `infra/experimental/chronos/manager.py`

### Chronos feature: Fast rebuilding

Chronos enables rebuilding projects efficiently in contexts where only a small patch
needs to be evalualted in the target. This is achieved by running a replay build script
in the build container, similarly to how a regular `build_fuzzers` command would run, but
with the caveat that the replay build script only performs a subset of the operations
of the original `build.sh`.

The replay build scripts are constructed in two ways: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Automated rebuilds

Chronos support automated rebuilding. This is meant as a generic mechanism to enable Chronos support for projects by default. This is achieved by:

1. Calling into a `replay_build.sh` script during the building inside the container [here](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/206656447b213fb04901d15122692d8dd4d45312/infra/base-images/base-builder/compile#L292-L296)
2. The `replay_build.sh` calls into `make_build_replayable.py`: [here](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/infra/base-images/base-builder/replay_build.sh)
3. `make_build_replayable.py` adjusts the build environment to wrap around common commands, to avoid performing a complete run of `build.sh`: [here](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/infra/base-images/base-builder/make_build_replayable.py).

The automated rebuilding works in combination with [Ccache](https://ccache.dev/), in order to facilitate cachine of e.g. `.o` files.
This means that during rebuild mode as long as we have a cacche, we don't need to e.g. run `configure` again and will only have to
rebuild the changed source code.

#### Option 2: Manually provided replay builds

`replay_build.sh` above, is simply just a wrapper script around `build.sh` that aims to enable
fast rebuilding of the project. This `replay_build.sh` can, however, be overwritten in the Dockerfile
of the project's builder image to support a custom approach to fast rebuilding. Two examples of this is [php](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/206656447b213fb04901d15122692d8dd4d45312/projects/php/replay_build.sh#L1) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/ffmpeg/replay_build.sh#L1).

Providing a manual `replay_build.sh` is likely more efficient at build time and can help speed up the process. Automated replay build scripts can also be erroneous.


#### Testing the validity of a replay build

The Chronos manager can use the `manager.py` to validate the validity of a
replay build for a given project:

```sh
python3 infra/experimental/chronos/manager.py check-test tinyobjloader
```

If the above command fails for the relevant project, then the replay build feature
does not work for the given project.

### Chronos feature:  Running tests of a project

The second part of Chronos is a feature to enable running the tests of a given
project. This is done by way of a script `run_tests.sh`. Samples of
this script include [jsonnet](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/jsonnet/run_tests.sh#L1) and [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/tinyobjloader/run_tests.sh#L1).


#### Run tests constraints

1. The `run_tests.sh` main task is to run the tests of a project and return `0` upon success and non-null otherwise.
2. The `run_tests.sh` script must leave the main repository in the state as it was prior to the execution of `run_tests.sh` relative to `git diff` (or similar diff features of other version control systems).

#### Testing the validity of run_tests.sh

The Chronos manager can use the `manager.py` to validate the validity of a
`run_tests.sh` script:

```sh
python3 infra/experimental/chronos/manager.py check-tests json-c
```


### Constraints imposed on replay_build.sh and run_tests.sh

At the core of chronos are the two scripts `replay_build.sh` and `run_tests.sh`. We have a default
mechanism for `replay_build.sh` so it's not strictly necessary to have a custom one, although it will
likely improve speed and maybe correctness by providing one.

There are three stages of the Chronos workflow:

1. The cached containers represent the state of a build container after a successful project build.
2. The `replay_build.sh` is able to rebuild a given project from the state of a cached container.
3. The `run_tests.sh` script is able to run the tests of a given project. This should be able to succeed following the running of a `replay_build.sh`.

The stages (2) and (3) must both support running without network connectivity.
Specifically, this means that the `replay_build.sh` must not do tasks e.g. fetch
dependencies, download corpus, or anything of this nature. Similarly, the `run_tests.sh`
must be able to operate completely in a closed network environment.


## Pre-built images.

Chronos cached images are build daily, and pre-built images are available at:

- `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/oss-fuzz/oss-fuzz-gen/<PROJECT>-ofg-cached-address`
- `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/oss-fuzz/oss-fuzz-gen/<PROJECT>-ofg-cached-coverage`

They can be used as drop-in replacements for the usual `gcr.io/oss-fuzz/<PROJECT>` images.
