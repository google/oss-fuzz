# CloudBuild for generating Chronos-cached images.
# Supports building by way of ccache now.
# High-level steps:
# 1) Build image for project
# 2) Run an ASAN build and store ccache
# 3) Copy ccache cache to host and copy into project's OSS-Fuzz folder
# 4) Build image for project and copy ccache in, storing image as *-ofg-cache-address
# 5) Run an coverage build and store ccache
# 6) Copy ccache cache to host and copy into project's OSS-Fuzz folder
# 7) Build image for project and copy ccache in, storing image as *-ofg-cache-coverage
# TODO (David): add support for use of dedicated replay_build.sh
