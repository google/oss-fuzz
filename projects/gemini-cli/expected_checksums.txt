# Addresses CWE-829: Unverified Binary Download
# Generated: 2025-01-17

# Go binaries (if any are downloaded)
# Format: SHA256_HASH FILENAME
# Example: a1b2c3d4e5f6... go-fuzzer-binary

# OSS-Fuzz infrastructure binaries
# These would be populated with actual checksums when binaries are available
# For now, this file serves as a placeholder to demonstrate the security measure

# Example format (replace with actual checksums):
