#As a general rule, we want coverage for all the third party code that we have
#in our repository. Two exceptions:
# 1) Coverage report doesn't analyze custom mutator code
#    (see https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/12143) --> exclude it
# 2) croaring is HUGE (its size is comparable to the entire nDPI codebase!)
#    and we are using only a tiny part of it.
#    Note that we do fuzz that part (also) via the specific fuzz_ds_bitmap fuzzer
