            ### What's Deployed
            - ✅ Multi-language fuzzing (JavaScript/TypeScript + Python)
            - ✅ Security coverage for CLI injection and input validation
            - ✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline
            - ✅ Health monitoring and alerts
            
            ### Links
            - **OSS-Fuzz Dashboard**: https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase?project=${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}
            - **Coverage Report**: https://oss-fuzz.com/coverage-report/job/libfuzzer_asan_${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}/latest
            - **Build Status**: https://oss-fuzz.com/build-status?project=${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}
            
            ### Next Steps
            1. Monitor initial fuzzing runs
            2. Review coverage reports
            3. Address any build issues
            4. Scale up fuzzing resources if needed
