Log4cxx fuzz tests are distributed as a part of https://github.com/apache/logging-log4cxx[the official project sources].
Here we only store the `Dockerfile` to build the container image to build and run fuzz tests.
Likewise, `build.sh` simply delegates to a build script distributed with the Log4j source code.
